Accessing Your Model's Data from a Controller

An updated version of this tutorial is available here using the latest version of Visual Studio. 
The new tutorial uses ASP.NET Core MVC, which provides many improvements over this tutorial.
This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC with controllers and views. 
Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core 2.0, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. 
We recommend you try the Razor Pages tutorial before the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:
•	Is easier to follow.
•	Covers more features.
•	Is the preferred approach for new application development.
